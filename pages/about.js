          With 2 impactful 6-month internships under my belt, I've honed my
          skills in real-world scenarios, working extensively with the
          technologies mentioned above. During my internships, I not only
          developed robust applications but also collaborated with
          cross-functional teams, ensuring seamless project delivery. Outside of
          work, I'm proud to have contributed to open-source initiatives like
          HackOctoberFest and GSSOC 2023, where I collaborated with fellow
          developers on meaningful projects.
